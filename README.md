## LDA model
1. import csv data as pandas
2. format as numpy array [string data, label]
3. segmentate string data by mecab
4. wash data (discarding symbol, mark, non-independent words)
5. make one-hot vector
6. make corpus
7. make dictionary
8. make LDA model

## CNN model
1. import csv data as pandas
2. format as numpy array [string data, label]
3. segmentate string data by mecab
4. wash data (discarding symbol, mark, non-independent words)
5. make one-hot vector
6. make CNN model by keras

## RNN model
1. import csv data as pandas
2. format as numpy array [string data, label]
3. segmentate string data by mecab
4. wash data (discarding symbol, mark, non-independent words)
5. make one-hot vector
6. make LSTM model by keras
